The primitive for creating 
a pipe is the pipe function. This
 creates both the reading and 
 writing ends of the pipe. It is 
 not very useful for a single 
 process to use a pipe to talk 
 to itself. In typical use, a process 
 creates a pipe just before it forks
  one or more child processes 
  (see Creating a Process). 
  The pipe is then used for 
  communication either between
   the parent or child processes, 
    or between two sibling processes.
